		Does the project C video provide information that could help us work on it?
		If it does, could it be released before this weekend?
		I was asking because that's what I thought the video would do,
		I wasn't expecting additional requirements to be released in the video.

		There will not be additional requirements. Period.
		If you have any questions, please just ask.

		What's will be there is that:
		(1) I will provide a template xv6 that includes 4 system calls.
		(2) will clarify what was asked in the piazza and emails
		(if you are looking at here, nothing much you learn more)
		- like you don't need to worry about concurrency (anyway this mentioned previously as well)
		- you can assume that we will not test complicated scenarios.
				you can assume record_start is the first call.

		There's literally nothing more.
		And also,
		please understand this is just simply you write a file and read a file.
		I know you can't use vectors,
		file i/os,
		and that's also the point of the homework.
		I do not plan to provide that code snippet here,
		and that's something you should figure out.
		
		That information will not be *intentionally* included in the announcement.

		All the code that you need is already in the xv6.
