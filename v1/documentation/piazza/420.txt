		I am starting on Project C,
		and was wondering about how to save specific system call arguments into the cur_record structure.
		
		The example fields in the slides are all char arrays,
		but some sys calls have arguments that can't be converted into strings.
		For example, sys_read has a struct file* argument.

		I am not sure how to save such an argument--
			do I need to add a new field to the cur_record structure to fit data types like this,
			or do I need to find a way to convert a file* and it's fields into a manageable set of strings?
			
		If this is too specific a question, just let me know. Any help would be appreciated.

		By the way, thank you for the extension!!!

		I don't think sys_read has a struct file* argument;
		all of its arguments can be serialized pretty easily

		Just write in a binary format. That might be easier.

		So basically I just need to static cast it to char*?
		No, you will see if you do cast then it wouldn't work.
		You need to save their values individually.
