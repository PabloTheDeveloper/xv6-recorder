		It seems that printf makes a call to sys_write for every character it prints to the console.
		Should this affect our implementation at all?

		If the testing program uses printf while recording,
		I'm afraid the limit of 100 system calls will quickly be reached.

		I will not test programs that use printf extensively. So, that should be fine.
		But technically, it should be supported by simply extending the max # of records.
		>>(update)
		Sorry, I need to correct one.
		In fact, you don't need to log write() because it is a deterministic system call.
		Others you should replay, but let's remove write() from the target record/replay syscall.
