		Say we record a program execution that makes three syscalls, A, B, and C.
		
		If we then remove syscall C from the program,
		and then try to replay it,
		what is the expected behavior?
		
		Should an error be thrown since syscall C was recorded, but never replayed?
		
		Or is this permissible behavior, since syscalls A and B were not modified?

		Print errors and exit. This is included in the slides and recording.

		I wasn't sure since the slides/recording said to
		"Print errors and kill a process if arguments/order does not match".
		
		In the case described above,
		
		the arguments and order would still match
		(
			when replaying,
			syscall A and B would be found in the correct order,
			with the correct arguments,
			i.e. the replay could be successfully carried out.
			However,
			the log file would have syscall C still recorded,
			but the program would never call it since we took it out
		)

		I see, so, additional syscalls recorded in the log.
		You can just ignore the additional syscall in the log,
		meaning that the replay is considered successful.
