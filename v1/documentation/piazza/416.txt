		in sys_fstat there is a file struct that contains a lot of fields inside of it.

		I know we are supposed to print out all of these fields (save them),

		I was just wondering if we need to decompose fields inside of the file struct (like inode and pipe). 

		I assume the answer is yes but just wanted to be sure!

		What do you mean by decomposing?
		If that means saving the inode structure from the inode number from stat structure? the answer is no.

		For example the file structure has an inode struct "ip",
		so i am wondering if we need to do the following:
		
		if our file struct is "f":
			do we need to f->ip->arg1
			f->ip->arg2
			f->ip->... 
			
			for all of the arguments in the ip structure?
			Or do we just need to that for all the arguments in the file struct f?

		You shouldn't need to worry about the contents of the file struct;
		just record the file descriptor that was passed in

		Correct
