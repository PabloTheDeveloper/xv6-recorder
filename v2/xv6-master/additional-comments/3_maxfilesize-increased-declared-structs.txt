In this commit I had declared my structs in "rr.h"
I had also updated the maxfile size to fit my structs


For the structs aspect:
	I added 1000 records, and 4 fields per each record.
	Each field could either be an input field or output field

	field are the arguments passed in and the outputs passed out of the system call

	I named it field, as the name arg is more associated with function inputs

	Furthermore, each field holds a value data which can be either of type int or Bytes.


For the update to maxfile size:
	I updated the NDIRECT const value in "fs.h"
	I updated the BSIZE const value in "fs.h"
	Those values are what set the filesize.
	Now, I can use my struct, as it is, without issue.
	It does take some time to load in.
