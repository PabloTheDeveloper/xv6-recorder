Task:

Check that order for getpid and systime work correctly on order match, order mismatch
	Check that multiple files can be created (lets say three)



Create Match function, and clear function for clearing the data in the Data Struct



Check on piazza what happens when there are too many replays in the program


Redo IO such that I can read each Syscall, and each field for each syscall, and assign it to my struct. Then update file size limit.
for write:
	for each syscall in syscalls:
		syscall_size = 0;
		if (syscall == uninitialized)
			break;
		
		syscall_size += sizeof(syscall.syscall)
		// determine size
		for each field in syscall:
